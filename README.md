ðŸš€ Modif.AI: AI-Powered Web Accessibility

The internet wasnâ€™t built with accessibility in mindâ€”but with Modif.AI, it can be.

Modif.AI is an AI-powered browser extension that allows users to modify websites in real time using generative AI. Whether you need larger text, high-contrast visuals, hands-free navigation, or text-to-speech functionality, Modif.AI ensures the internet adapts to your needsâ€”not the other way around.

ðŸ’¡ Simply ask, and weâ€™ll adjust websites instantly.

âœ… Need bigger text? Weâ€™ll resize it.
âœ… Prefer white text on a black background? Weâ€™ll automatically adjust itâ€”an improvement proven to help individuals with dyslexia.
âœ… Struggle with clicking buttons due to ALS, Parkinsonâ€™s, or motor impairments? Simply use your voice, and weâ€™ll handle clicks for you.
âœ… Want text-to-speech? Weâ€™ll read pages aloud so you can listen instead of reading.
